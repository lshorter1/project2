<h3>Even though H&M has some types of sales, they give sales for things that nobody wants.Now I know you want that Forever 21 sale.</h3>
<h4><p><i> In my own eyes, when I walk into Forever 21 I see almost everything I wasn't already. Then when I walk into H&M, its just like its dry.. nothing to see there..NEXT!.</i></p></h4>
